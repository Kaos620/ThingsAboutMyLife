        Ok, my college teacher made me do this web page about my
        life and my expectations for my professional carrer... That
        made me think, a lot... Sooo, here I come. I actually have a
        pretty normal life, of course I had some moments in my life
        that were “unusual”, but it’s fine, I was born in Araxá MG
        and stil living here since then. When I was younger (about
        2/3 years old) I got pretty sick, almost died because of a
        bacteria called ‘Staphylococcus aureus’ wich usually is just
        a normal bacteria, but in some cases can get stronger,
        causing pneumonia and even stronger symptoms , thats what
        happend to me, first the pneumonia, then, water in my lungs,
        had to have a emergency surgery and be interned in the
        hospital for almost two months. After get out of the
        hospital I had some sequels, being one of them Asthma (wich
        I had for almost 9 years but healed thanks to the swimming
        lessons and training). In Elementary School I suffered a lot
        of bullying, most because I was short, quiet, asthmatic,
        used glasses, braces, liked videogames, comics and didn’t
        know how to play football (the nerd stereotype), that made
        me have some social skills problems, not having friends,
        etc. In Middle School I started to do martial arts,
        beggining with Karate that made me start to have better
        social skills and being more confident, also moving to
        another school and having my first friend. In the end of it
        I had changed a lot, learned to talk more, had some friends
        and got taller. In the first year of High School I was
        already a total different person, taller, stronger,
        confident and still liking videogames, anime, comics and
        more. Then the quarantine, nothing happend in almost 2
        years, just played a lot of videogames, and learned English.
        And now i’m in College, total new life. I still have some
        sequels of the bullying I suffered years ago, scared of some
        things I prefer not to talk about, but I’m happy and
        greatful for what I learned.

      <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
        My professional expectations for the future are quite
        simple. I wanna learn more and more about programming, data
        language etc. I wanna have a job where I earn a lot o money,
        being able to travel abroad, buy a good house and give my
        parents the life they coudn’t have when they were younger. I
        wanna be the professional that is always improving, learn
        more than everyone else, always taking with me my own life
        style, wich is, always trying to choose the hardest options,
        most people don’t go for it, so if do, I’ll be more capable
        of things that aren’t usual for others to be.
